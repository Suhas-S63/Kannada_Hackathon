# Kannada_Hackathon

We have undertaken several initiatives in the "Kannada Hackathon" project, focusing on enhancing technology for the Kannada language. Below are the key highlights of my work:
##
Image to Text Extraction: Developed an advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system capable of extracting text from Kannada images. This technology leverages machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to improve accuracy and efficiency.

## 
 *Writer Identification: Designed a system for identifying the authors of Kannada manuscripts and handwritten texts. This project employs the VGG16 CNN architecture to analyze handwriting features and accurately classify the writer based on their unique writing style.
  * The Writer Identification system can be used in forensic analysis to identify authors in criminal investigations, assist researchers in analyzing historical manuscripts, and aid educational institutions in providing personalized feedback on handwriting.
Keyword Search: Implemented a keyword search functionality for Kannada text files, allowing users to conduct custom searches. This feature streamlines the process of finding specific information within large volumes of Kannada text.

Commitment to Kannada Development: My projects aim to promote the growth of the Kannada language and its cultural heritage by integrating advanced technology and resources tailored for the Kannada-speaking community.
